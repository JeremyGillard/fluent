# Fluent Application

The aim of this application is to be part of a wider methodology for learning new words in a language and being able to reuse them when needed, both orally and in writing.

The methodology is the following:

Phase 1 - feed the system:
1. Try the exercice of expressing myself by speaking or writing.
2. Whenever I face an idea that I would like to express but for which I don't have the word in English, get it and register it in the system.
3. The first time a discover the word, I have to make 5 sentences with it.

Phase 2 - reviewing words:
4. Whenever I enter a word in the system that already exists, I have to do the same exercise as in point 3.
5. I can see the words in the system that I know the least (also ordered by reviewed time) and try to make the exercise too.

N.B.: Until I will have an MVP up and running, I will just feed the system as a json file to be able to import it in the database easely later.
